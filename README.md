## Purpose

This is an overly complicated git cheat sheet project, created to provide react practice while turning my git cheat sheet into a webpage.

## Getting started

1. Fork this project
2. Click “Clone or download” button and copy the link
3. Change to the directory where you want to save (for example, if you want to save to desktop: ```cd Desktop```)
4. git clone {paste link from step 2 here} (ex. ```git clone https://github.com/heatem/git-react-practice.git```)
5. Change into the project folder (```cd git-react-practice```)
6. ```npm -v``` (to confirm npm is installed. If not, check this out treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)
7. ```npm install -g gatsby-cli``` (might need to do ```sudo npm install -g gatsby-cli```)
8. ```npm install```
9. ```gatsby develop```
10. In your browser, go to localhost:8000

Open the project in your text editor/IDE (ex. VS Code). I have put some git commands in the index.js file (path: git-react-practice/src/pages/index.js).
- **Task 1:** Create a components folder
- **Task 2:** Create a header component for the title of the page and replace the h3 in the index.js file with the component
- **Task 3:** Create component(s) for each section of the cheat sheet in the way you see fit, then replace the html with the components in index.js
- **Bonus:** Style any/all components
